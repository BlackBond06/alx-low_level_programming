This project is a demonstration of bit manipulation techniques in the C programming language. Bit manipulation involves performing operations at the bit level, allowing us to manipulate and extract specific bits from data types such as integers. Understanding bit manipulation is essential for optimizing code, implementing efficient algorithms, and working with low-level data structures.
